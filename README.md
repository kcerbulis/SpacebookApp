# SpacebookApp

Spacebook is a totally unique, non-plagiarised social media platform which allows astronauts to
communicate with each other. Users sign up for an account with Spacebook and can then add their
friends, view each other’s profiles, and write on each other’s walls.

[AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) JavaScript guide was used in combination with a linter
to maintain consistent code quality throughout the application. An additional [React Strap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
UI library was user for consistent styling, combined with [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/) colour palate for increased accessibility.


## Accessibility

This project was developed with high user accessibility in mind. Living with a cognitive learning disorder has allowed me to be an effective use case during the design of the application and ensures that a sufficient level of accessibility is present.
The application is designed to assist users with:

1.Cognitive Learning Disabilities (autism, attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia, intellectual and memory loss)
2.Visual Disabilities (Colour Blindness, Restless Eye Syndrome, Partial or Full Blindness)
3.Auditory Processing Disorder
4.Elderly Age
5.Irregular Internet Connection
6.Deprecated Technologies

Application layout is made simple and straightforward. To reduce complexity of use, not too much information is displayed in any given view. However, most section of the application are accessible by no more than 2 click (after login, if credentials allow). This prevents users with cognitive and visual disabilities from becoming overwhelmed by their screen contents while still maintaining high functionality and ease of use.
To increase accessibility for users with [colorblindness](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23648FFF-%23785EF0-%23DC267F-%23FE6100-%23FFB000) or dyslexia (like myself), a carefully chosen colour pallet was used, curtesy of [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/). The use of different IBM background colours on different screen components helps individuals with visual or cognitive disabilities view, interpret and navigate pages more easily.
To assist people with attention deficit, dyslexia, blindness, or any condition that reduces visibility, you are encouraged to use [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1), [Mac](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/academic-support/assistive-technology/mac-os-x-voiceover#:~:text=Mac%20OS%20X%20Snow%20Leopard,new%20web%20page%20support%20options), [Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en-GB), or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios) screen reader.
All images used have an ALT tag that allows the screen reader to read it to the user. These are designed to assist any specially abled users.
In cases where users have outdated technology, broken/cracked screen or visual issues that reduce reading visibility, all visible components are made with large, readable, and cantered fonts supported by a well-contrasted background. This allows the pages information to be easily interpreted regardless of hardware or visibility. Buttons will always be contrasted colours and large.
