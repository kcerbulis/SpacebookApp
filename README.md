## Accessibility

This project was developed with high user accessibility in mind. Living with a cognative learning dissorder has allowed me
to be an effective use case during the design of the application and ensures that a sufficient level of accesabilty is present. 
The application is designed to assist users with:

1.Cognitive Learning Disabilities (autism, attention deficit, dyslexia, dyscalculia, intellectual and memory loss)
2.Visual Dissabilities (Colour Blindness, Restless Eye Syndrome, Partial or Full Blindness)
3.Auditory Processing Disorder
4.Elderly Age
5.Irregular Internet Connection
6.Deprecated Technologies

  Application layout is made simple and straighforward. To reduce complexity of use, not too much information is diplayed in any given view. However,
  most section of the application are accessible by no more than 2 click (after login, if credentials allow). This prevents users with cognative and 
  visual dissabilities from becoming overwhelmed by their screen contents while still maintaining high functionality and ease of use. 
  
  To incriece accesabilty for users with colour blindness or dyslexia (like myself), a carefully chosen colour pallet was used,
  curtesy of [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/). This pallete was specifically designed for people with [colorblindness](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23648FFF-%23785EF0-%23DC267F-%23FE6100-%23FFB000).
  In addition, the use of multiple pallate colours on different screen components can help people with other visual or cognitive disabilities
  to view un interpret to page more easily. This segnificantly incrieces the application usability.
  
  To assist people with attention deficit, dyslexia, blindness or any condition that reduces visability, you are encouraged to use [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1), 
  [Mac](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/academic-support/assistive-technology/mac-os-x-voiceover#:~:text=Mac%20OS%20X%20Snow%20Leopard,new%20web%20page%20support%20options.), [Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en-GB), or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios) screen reader. 
  These are designed to assist any specially abled users.
  
  In cases where users have outdated technology, broken/cracked screen or visual issues that reduce reading vissibility, all visible components are made
  with large, readable and centered fonts supported by a well-contrasted background. This allows the pages information to be easily interpreted regardless of 
  hardware or visibility. Buttons will always be contrasted colors and large.
